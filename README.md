# Magician.app

Who doesn't want to boot their computers with their smart watch? Isn't this the future we're supposed to be living in?

Anyway, this was my initial stab at making an (actually useful) WatchOS app. Developed over the course of a week, initially, then duplicated in preparation for a port to Swift and WatchOS 2 which was never finished.

The loading animation for the WatchKit app was made in Adobe After Effects, to give the app a bit more "pop" on the Watch.

No longer under active development.
